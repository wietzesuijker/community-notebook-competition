# Submission

## Abstract (100 words)

This notebook detects spring green-up across a 2,000 m elevation gradient in NE Italy, from the Po Plain to the Julian Alps, transferring around 100 MB from a multi-terabyte archive. Each analysis step teaches a specific EOPF Zarr v3 concept by needing it: consolidated metadata for single-request discovery, sharding for fewer HTTP requests, multi-resolution groups for progressive zoom, and co-located SCL masks for quality filtering. We compute NDVI (10m) and NDRE (20m) change between autumn and spring, revealing altitude-dependent phenology. A real-world v2/v3 media type mismatch in STAC metadata demonstrates why format probing matters for robust implementations.

## AI Disclosure: Describe how you used AI in authoring this notebook (100 words)

Claude (Anthropic) was used as a coding assistant throughout development for code iteration, matplotlib figure styling, and structuring the notebook narrative to align with the competition template. All scientific decisions (study area selection, index choice, elevation zone placement, three-date arc design, interpretation of results) were made by the author. The v2/v3 format mismatch discovery and the architecture explanations draw on the author's direct experience contributing to the GDAL Zarr driver, GeoZarr conformance tests, and QGIS GeoZarr plugin.

## Feedback (If you answered `true` to `had_challenges_working_with_sample_service_data` please provide feedback here!)

The STAC metadata declares `application/vnd+zarr; version=2; profile=multiscales` but the actual data is Zarr v3 (zarr_format=3 in zarr.json). This media type mismatch causes clients that trust the STAC declaration to use a v2 reader, which fails on v3 data. Robust implementations need to probe zarr.json directly. This has been addressed in [data-pipeline#94](https://github.com/EOPF-Explorer/data-pipeline/pull/94), though existing STAC items haven't been re-registered yet.
